<p> There have been several people in Sahej's life that have had a powerful impact on him. 
    Some have been there his entire life but some have only been there for a small moment in time. 
    His parents are perhaps the most important people that have had the largest impact on him. 
    From learning how to go potty on his own to how to be a responsible, caring, and loving adult. 
    They have been there to guide him through all of it. There have also been friends and strangers 
    that have changed. His oldest and best friend have experienced everything together and have been 
    there for each other in the toughest of times. Sahej has truly learned to importance of friendship 
    through his friend. Also people that Sahej has met on his travels have given him a deeper sense of 
    the truly vast and diverse world that he lives in.
