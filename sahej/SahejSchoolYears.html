<p> Sahej has had a wild schooling experience. He has switched 6 schools in 6 different countries in his entire life. 
    PreSchool started in Paris but the Sahej went to Kindergarten in Doha, Qatar. Life was good for little Sahej, 
    coming home early from school, taking afternoon naps and his mom making his Favorite lunches for when he would come home. 
    As he grew a little older he remembers doing school science projects about Hydroelectricity which mostly his parents did for him. 
    As time passed school became harder but Sahej never let that get in the way of having fun. He would always have time to 
    spend with friends, either riding their bikes around town or having
    Nerf wars or sometimes even actually fighting. Sahej was glad that he never spent too much time on his phone when he was younger. 
    High school though was a different story. Academics were hard and the stress was high. Time was limited but even then he 
    found times to spend with friends and enjoy the few moments to make the best of memories. Like playing basketball on the 
    weekends or getting boba 
    with friends.
