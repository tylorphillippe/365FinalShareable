    There are a lot of important people in Tylor's life, but a few mean more to him than life itself. 
    First is his girlfriend, Tessa, who he has been dating for over four years. She has made him realize 
    his own self-worth and has helped him through so many things that he wouldn't be able to do by himself. 
    She is the reason that he is the person he is today, and she'll always be there for him. Next, his mom, 
    Kristi, has helped him through countless difficult experiences and has taught him so much about life. 
    He knows that no matter what, she will be there to support him and he can never thank her enough. 
    Mrs. Bennett was Tylor's gifted class teacher and she was essentially a second mom to him from the 
    time he was in first grade until she passed away a couple months before graduation. She helped him 
    learn how to succeed academically, despite his severe ADHD. Lastly, his cat, Baldr, is one of his 
    best buddies in the whole world and he's definitely the cutest living creature to ever exist.
