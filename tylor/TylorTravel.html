    Tylor has traveled quite a bit, but has only left the United States once. In 2017, he went on a trip
    to Costa Rica with members of the Biology Club at his high school, and it is one the greatest 
    experiences he's ever had. He has also traveled to Colorado several times with his dad and brother 
    because they go on skiing trips during winter break every year. Other states that Tylor has been to 
    include Florida, New York, Ohio, and Tennessee. One week after the Spring 2021 semester ends, Tylor 
    will be going to Cozumel, Mexico with his parents and his 17-year-old brother.
