    <p>Tylor went to school at Hallsville School District from pre-school until he graduated high school in 2018. Hallsville is a 
		very small school district, so Tylor knew all of his classmates and it was easy for him to make friends. Some of Tylor's 
		friends from pre-school and kindergarten are still very close friends with him 16 years later. Tylor always excelled academically
		and was part of the district's gifted program from the time he was in the first grade until he graduated. He was also a member of 
		the National Honor Society, Biology Club, Spanish Club, and Future Business Leaders of America. Tylor's favorite extra-curricular 
		activity was participating in any band program that the school offered, including Marching Band, Drumline (Tylor was the 
		Drumline Captain), Concert Band, Pep Band, and Jazz Band. He also loved competing in district and state solo competitions and 
		received 2 "one" ratings at state, which is the highest score one can achieve. Tylor also loved writing drum solos to perform at
		Jazz Band performances, and you can click the link <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCq0qGEfMEM">here</a> to see a 
		video of one his favorites.
