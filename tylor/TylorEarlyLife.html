 <p>Tylor was born in Columbia, Missouri on April 28, 2000. He lived in Columbia until he went to college 
   at Missouri State University in Springfield in 2018. Tylor was the first child that his parents had, 
   and he was the only child until May 21, 2003, when his little brother, Trevor, was born. They were 
   the only children until his youngest brother, Toby, was born on February 17, 2015. Tylor's early life 
   was very calm and happy; he spent a lot of time playing outside, watching movies, and playing video 
   games with Trevor. He has always loved exploring, watching movies and playing video games, and those 
   are things that he still loves today. Tylor lived in Columbia, but because of his location near the 
   edge of town, he always attended school at Hallsville School District in Hallsville, Missouri. 
   Hallsville is a very small school district, so Tylor knew all of his classmates and had no difficulty 
   making friends. He was also very close with his cousins on his dad's side of the family, and spent
   a lot of time with them.</p>
